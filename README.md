# Kcalibrator
Alternative K-factor calibration pattern generator.
Should provide better (or at least different) way to calibrate Liniar Advance (and similar algorythms) than default [Marlin K-factor Calibration Pattern](https://marlinfw.org/tools/lin_advance/k-factor.html).

## Requirements
Program is written in Python and available in 2 versions:
+ Python script (requires Python 3 to run, no additional packages needed)
+ Windows x64 executable (frozen with pyinstaller, more convinient, no requirements to run)

## Usage
This script generates pattern fot Linear Advance K-factor calibration for Marlin (and other firmwares which use M900 to adjust pressure control algorithms).
The pattern consists of a rectangular wall printed with sharp changes in speed and with K-factor increasing from bottom to top (see screenshot).
Print the pattern and find the height where it looks the best.
Corners should not bulge, flow should be homogeneous with as little influence from speed changes as possible, seam should be barely noticeable.
Calculate desired K-factor from this height and parameters you used to generate the pattern.

![Pattern example](img/RH_example_pattern.png)

Program has a simple grafical user interface (contributed by [Foreytor](https://github.com/Foreytor)) allowing to change various settings of the pattern generator.
User can adjust:
- Basic machine parameters (bed size, filament diameter, autoleveling, etc.)
- Basic printing settings (temperature, cooling, retraction, etc.)
- Pattern parameters (size, speeds, K-factor range and step, number of perimeters, number of layers prited with each specific K-factor, etc.)

Current configuration can be saved to Kcalibrator.cfg file in the same directory with the prigram (it will also be automatically generated if missing on program startup).
Generated G-code files are also saved in the same directory with the program.

## Good luck!
